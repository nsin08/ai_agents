## Slide — Title

AI Agents: Domain Specialization & Scale (Level 4)

---

## Slide — Level 4 Outcomes

- Apply patterns to real domains (support, coding, medical, ops)
- Choose deployment model + operational ownership
- Plan for scale: multi-tenancy, cost controls, eval platforms
- Adopt future patterns intentionally (not hype-driven)

---

## Slide — P1: Customer Support Architecture

- Read-only MVP → assisted write → autonomous resolution
- Escalation and HITL patterns are mandatory

---

## Slide — P2: Coding Agent Architecture

- Tight toolchain integration
- Verification via tests/lint/build is the safety mechanism

---

## Slide — P3: Medical Agent Architecture

- Privacy, auditability, conservative behavior
- Clear refusal and escalation policies

---

## Slide — P4: DevOps Troubleshooting Architecture

- Tool-heavy diagnosis + high operational risk
- Safe mitigations + rollback + partial success handling

---

## Slide — P5: Deployment Models

- Self-managed vs agent-as-a-service tradeoffs
- Ownership: who is accountable for reliability, cost, and compliance?

---

## Slide — P6: Future Directions

- Eval platforms, better tool runtimes, multi-agent collaboration
- “Adopt with gates”: safety + eval + telemetry or don’t ship it

---

## Slide — Capstone

- Build a domain agent or a platform component (multi-tenancy, eval, multi-agent)
