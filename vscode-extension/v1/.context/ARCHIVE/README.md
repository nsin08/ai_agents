## Why These Files Were Archived

The documentation was reorganized to improve user experience and navigation:

1. **Consolidation:** Content was merged into comprehensive guides (DEVELOPMENT.md, BUILD.md)
2. **Hub Model:** Single README.md as navigation hub with clear paths for different users
3. **Reduced Duplication:** Eliminated overlapping content across multiple files
4. **Improved Navigation:** Clear links between related guides
5. **Better Discoverability:** Users can find what they need from the main README.md
