**Date:** January 27, 2026  
**Question:** Should we assign issue and PR to nsin08?  
**Answer:** ✅ ALREADY DONE - NO FURTHER ACTION NEEDED

## Framework Analysis

### space_framework Guidelines on AI Agent Responsibilities

**What AI Agents CAN Do:**
- ✅ Read/create issues following framework templates
- ✅ Implement code within assigned Story scope
- ✅ Create branches and open PRs
- ✅ Run tests and provide evidence
- ✅ **Request reviews** (never self-approve)
- ✅ Write files per Rule 11

**What AI Agents CANNOT Do:**
- ❌ Merge PRs (CODEOWNER only)
- ❌ Approve PRs (human reviewers only)
- ❌ Skip workflow states
- ❌ Change issue state without meeting exit criteria

### Assignment Philosophy

Per the framework principle: **"Request reviews (never self-approve)"**

This translates to:
1. AI agents **CREATE and OPEN** PRs
2. AI agents **ASSIGN to CODEOWNER** for review (appropriate)
3. AI agents **REQUEST reviews** from humans
4. CODEOWNER makes approval and merge decisions
5. AI agents never self-approve or self-merge

## Current State - ✅ COMPLIANT

### PR #124
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Assigned to:** nsin08 (CODEOWNER)
- **Comments:** AI agent provided comprehensive details
- **Framework Compliance:** ✅ CORRECT

### Issue #79 (Phase 4)
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Assigned:** Not assigned (open for CODEOWNER to decide)
- **Comments:** AI agent added completion details with PR link
- **Framework Compliance:** ✅ CORRECT

### Issue #74 (Phase 1)
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Assigned:** Not assigned (open for CODEOWNER to decide)

## Best Practice Implementation

### What We Did (✅ Correct)
1. ✅ Created PR #124 with comprehensive description

### What CODEOWNER (nsin08) Will Do

5. Update issue states as needed
