# P12 — Multi-Agent Collaborative System

## Objective
Build a system where multiple specialized agents collaborate on complex tasks via a coordinator/critic pattern.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 3+ specialized agents working together
- [ ] Communication protocol defined and working
- [ ] Coordinator manages workflow and failure handling
- [ ] End-to-end workflow demo successful

## Scope
- In: roles (e.g., researcher, planner, executor), communication protocol, coordinator/supervisor, shared state, cross-agent failure handling, end-to-end demo
- Out: production deployment, self-organizing agents

## Constraints
- Complexity: high (architecture review recommended)
- Timeline: 6 weeks

## Suggested Approach
1. Define agent roles and shared state schema
2. Design communication protocol (messages, constraints)
3. Build coordinator + critic and failure handling
4. Implement demo workflow; run end-to-end tests
