## Lab to Chapter Mapping

| Lab | Topic | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced | Pro |
|-----|-------|----------|--------------|----------|-----|
| Lab 00 | Environment setup | Ch1 | - | - | - |
| Lab 01 | RAG fundamentals | Ch3 | - | - | - |
| Lab 02 | Tools | Ch4 | Ch6 | - | - |
| Lab 03 | Orchestrator | - | Ch1 | Ch2 (multi-agent) | - |
| Lab 04 | Memory | Ch5 | Ch2 | - | - |
| Lab 05 | Context engineering | Ch5 | Ch3 | - | - |
| Lab 06 | Observability | - | Ch4 | Ch5 | - |
| Lab 07 | Safety | - | - | Ch1 | - |
| Lab 08 | Multi-agent systems | - | - | Ch2 | - |
| Lab 09 | MCP tool servers | - | Ch6 | Ch6 (security boundary) | - |
| Lab 10 | Vector retrieval + context packing | Ch5 (extension) | Ch2, Ch3 | - | - |

## Notes

- Beginner labs (00-02) focus on foundations.
- Intermediate labs (03-06) focus on production patterns.
- Advanced labs (07-08) focus on safety and multi-agent coordination.
- Labs 09-10 extend the intermediate track with modern integration patterns (MCP) and retrieval/context/memory management.
