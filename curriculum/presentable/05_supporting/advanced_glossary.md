2. **Human-in-the-loop (HITL)**: A required human approval step before action.
3. **Escalation policy**: Rules for when to transfer to a human operator.
4. **Model routing**: Selecting a model based on cost, latency, or risk.
5. **Guardrail**: A constraint that prevents unsafe behavior.
6. **Audit trail**: Immutable record of decisions and tool calls.
7. **Canary deployment**: Gradual rollout to a small segment.
8. **Rollback**: Automatic revert after failure detection.
9. **SLO**: Service level objective for reliability or latency.
10. **Runbook**: Step-by-step incident response instructions.
11. **Error budget**: Allowed failure rate over time.
12. **System prompt control**: Centralized management of system instructions.
13. **Prompt versioning**: Tracking prompt changes like code releases.
14. **Multi-agent coordination**: Orchestrating specialized agents.
15. **Task decomposition**: Splitting a goal into sub-tasks for agents.
16. **Consensus check**: Agreement between multiple agents before action.
17. **Risk gating**: Blocking actions above a risk threshold.
18. **Data boundary**: Defined limits for data access or retention.
19. **Token cost tracking**: Measuring cost per request or task.
