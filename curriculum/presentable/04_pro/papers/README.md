# Pro Level Reading Pack (Papers)

This folder contains paper summaries used by the Level 4 (Pro) curriculum.

Principles:
- Engineering-oriented (what to adopt, what to avoid, how to test).
- Linked to curriculum chapters and implementation patterns.
- Keep claims grounded in what the paper actually shows; treat blog claims as secondary.

- `01_chain_of_thought_prompting.md`
