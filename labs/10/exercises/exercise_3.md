# Exercise 3: Memory consolidation + evaluation

1) Inspect `VectorRagAgent.semantic_facts` after multiple calls.

2) Extend `_consolidate_memory` to store:
- number of episodes per tenant
- last cited doc_id

3) Run the golden set evaluation (`evaluate.py`) and confirm results remain deterministic.
