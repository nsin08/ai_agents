# Exercise 2: Modify max_turns Parameter

**Objective:** Observe behavior under execution constraints.

## Steps
1. Run with `max_turns=1` and record outcomes for the three sample tasks.
2. Run with `max_turns=10` and record outcomes.
3. Note:
   - Task success vs early termination
   - Turn count used
   - Any refinement steps taken

## Deliverable
- Comparison table showing task success rate and turn counts for `max_turns=1` vs `max_turns=10`.
